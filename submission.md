We welcome abstracts on research looking at understudied network data in computational social science. 
Please submit your abstract as a PDF with no more than one page of text (excluding figures) - you can use any template you like. Abstracts should clearly state which datasets are studied and whether the data is publicly available in some form. We are happy to accept submissions that study mainstream social networks such as Twitter (now X) and Facebook in addition to another understudied dataset but we ask that submissions do not only focus on large platforms like Twitter or Facebook. 

The abstract should detail the core research ideas and the features of the dataset used. Optional figures and references are permitted. Accepted submissions will be presented in person through a 10-minute talk. Unfortunately, we cannot accept remote presentations. Please submit your contribution here:
