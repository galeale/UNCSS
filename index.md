            <p>The decline of academic APIs like Crowdtangle, Reddit, and Twitter, along with doubts about the EU’s Digital Services Act facilitating data access, raises concerns for the prosecution of social media research. However, this opens new avenues to study less-explored networks like the Fediverse, Bluesky, WhatsApp, Telegram, and the Podcast Ecosystem. Although these platforms are understudied due to data accessibility challenges, existing datasets are often overlooked. The aim of this event is to promote computational social science research using
understudied social network data, and help researchers find datasets that they were not
previously aware of.
            </p>
            <p>We invite contributed presentations (10 minutes) on network analysis (remember this is NetSci!) in computational social science using understudied datasets (i.e., studies NOT only using Twitter or Facebook data). The purpose of the satellite is not to teach data acquisition methods using APIs, the DSA, or scraping – others have covered this topic previously – but we ask presenters to comment on where their data is available, and what problems might be studied with the datasets that already exist.</p>
