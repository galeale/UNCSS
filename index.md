            <h2>Call For Contribution</h2>
            <p>We invite contributed presentations (10 minutes) on network analysis (remember this is NetSci!) in computational social science using understudied datasets (i.e., studies NOT only using Twitter or Facebook data). The purpose of the satellite is not to teach data acquisition methods using APIs, the DSA, or scraping – others have covered this topic previously – but we ask presenters to comment on where their data is available, and what problems might be studied with the datasets that already exist.</p>
